/**
 * This is the main class for handling database connections.
 * <p>
 * It is implemented as a wrapper around the Postgres JBDC
 * driver and Apache DBCP2 connection pool. A connection
 * pool is simply a way to recycle database connection,
 * in order to prevent the overhead of making a new data
 * -base connection on every request.
 * Read more: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20712571
 * <p>
 * A connection pool also gives us the opportunity to use
 * prepared statement caching, which means that the old
 * prepared statements can also be reused instead of creating
 * new ones. This especially works well for applications
 * running the same queries many times.
 * Read more: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12141276
 * <p>
 * While using a single connection would work, there are little
 * to no downsides to using a connection pool.
